# Authorization Server
This is a support Authorization Server for Verifiable Credential Issuance. Please refer to the main project at [thesiswallet](https://github.com/davidodev3/thesiswallet).


## Installation
Clone this repository. Run "npm start" on the shell to install dependencies and run the server.

### Changing the port
By default the server listens on port 3000. If you want to change that modify line 70 of `server.js`.

## `config.json`
The `config.json` file contains a private key. As this is a demo project this was intended for simplicity, in a real application you would want to hide that.
